<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
</div></div>
These terms of service cover your use and access to the services ("the service"), software ("the software") and websites ("the website") provided by the Open Access Button. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information. By using our service, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms and to accept our Privacy Policy.     
<h2>Registration</h2>     
You may browse the website and view content without registering, but as a condition to using certain aspects of the service, you are required to register with a valid email address. You are solely responsible and liable for activity that occurs on your account.
<h2>Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
We trust you to use our services responsibly. You agree not to misuse the Open Access Button services ("Services"). For example, you must not, and must not attempt to do the following:

    * access, tamper with, or use non public areas or parts of the Services, or shared areas of the Services you have not been invited to;
    * interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network
    * use automated or other means to create accounts in bulk or to access the Services other than by using our official interface and/or APIs;
    * violate the law in any way including storing, publishing or sharing material that is fraudulent, defamatory, misleading, or that violates the privacy or infringes the rights of others.
<h2>Third Party Sites and Services</h2>
Open Access Button also provides links to or interacts with a wide variety of third-party websites, including interactive links to sites like social media via application programming interfaces (APIs). When you access third party websites, you do so at your own risk. These other websites are not under the control of the Open Access Button, and you acknowledge that Open Access Button is not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness, security or any other aspect of such websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply endorsement by Open Access Button. 
<h2>Copyright/Intellectual Property</h2>
We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. Through the use of the service, if you directly or indirectly share research with others that you do not have the appropriate rights to share, the Open Access Button will not be held liable for the consequences of those actions. 
<br></br>
We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement on the service or website if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our takedown process. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.
<br></br>
   
<h2>Changes to Our Policies</h2>
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. However, any revised privacy policy will be consistent with our mission. If we make any substantive changes to our policies, we will place notice in our blog and post notice of changes on this page.

* 26th of September 2016: Updated text to remove references to passwords and include an update policy similar to our privacy policy. Also cleaned up some formatting and removed "welcome message" at the start of the policy. This was not posted to our blog as it wasn't deemed a substantial change.
