<p>The Open Access Button loves libraries. Many of our team are librarians, and we're inclubated in SPARC, a coalition of research libraries. We’re embarking on a new adventure to create open scholarly infrastructure for and with the library community. Over time, this page will detail that adventure. For now, check out our <a href="https://blog.openaccessbutton.org/putting-the-oa-into-interlibrary-loan-9d5fa5eb25d4">latest announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>For the past year, the Open Access Button has been working to integrate our service with library catalogs and interlibrary loan systems — to surface accessible copies of articles directly through library discovery systems and fulfill interlibrary loan requests instantly when accessible copies are available in repositories. We’re excited about the possibilities that this integration creates to bring interlibrary loan closer into researchers’ workflows, improve the number of articles available to users, and accelerate the speed at which users can access research all while saving libraries time and money.</blockquote>
