        Our API allows you to find out if an article, published at some URL but not freely available there,
        is freely available anywhere else. It can also check for supporting data too. You can also search all the
        availability checks we have made, all the requests for access our users have created, and all their declarations
        of support too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API uses JSON for all posts and responses.  Links to example responses are shown for each api operation documented below.<!-- - install a JSON viewer plugin to your
        browser to make them easier to read-->. When POSTing data, remember to set the Content-Type header to application/json, e.g.
        for curl this header is added like so: <code>curl -H "Content-Type:application/json"</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no enforced rate limits, so limit your requests to a maximum of one request per second. If we notice problems we'll suspend your account and contact you about your needs.
        Although most api operations do not require authorisation, we ask that you please obtain your own API key.
      </p>
      <p id="apikey">
        Please <a href="/account?next=/api" class="label label-info">sign up / sign in</a> to see your API key here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Include the API key you are provided in either a URL param called "apikey"
        or in a header called "x-apikey".
        So, a curl call to the availability operation below might look like so (if you choose to use headers):
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-apikey: yourRegisteredApikey" '{{api}}'
      </p>

        This is the prefix for all api calls and simply returns an indication of api status.

      </h3>
      <p>
        Provide a url-encoded URL in a parameter named "url". The api will accept DOIs, PMIDs, PMC IDs, titles, and citations all of
        which can alternately be passed in the "url" parameter.  The API will try to guess which type is being provided.  
        Alternately, the specific type can be passed in by using a more specific parameter name: "doi", "pmc", "pmid", "title", "citation".
        In any case, note that only one parameter can be provided, and the preference for which to provide is:
        url, doi, pmc, pmid, title, citation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple way to make a request to the availability API is the following one liner where YOURURL is your "url" paremeter:
        curl -H "x-apikey: yourRegisteredApikey" -X GET "https://api.openaccessbutton.org/availability?url=YOURURL"
      </p>
      <p>
        The response returned lists objects of any "availability" found, with each object declaring "type" (currently either article or data)
        and the "url" where this object is found.
      </p>
      <p>
        The response also includes a list of any open "requests", each object showing the request "type" and the request "id".
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally the response includes an "accepts" list which shows what sorts of new requests we will accept.  we currently only
        accept "article" or "data" requests, and we won't accept new requests if already available or already requested.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note we do blacklist some URLs - see below for more info and how to check it.

      <h3>
        POST
      </h3>
      <p>
        Create a new request by POSTing a JSON object to this endpoint.
        Please remember to include the header: content-type:"application/json"    The JSON object itself must contain at least the "url" parameter - the URL to create a request for. The
        "url" parameter can also be formatted as a url or alternately as a DOI, PMID, PMC ID, title, or citation.  NOTE that in any case, these values should be put in the "url" parameter, NOT in other parameter names (like doi, citation, etc).
    
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
        When you provide DOI, PMID and PMC ID values in the "url parameter, please format the value in a URL format.
        DOI can be provided as https://doi.org/10.1234/567890, PMID
        as https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12345678, and PMC ID as https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1234567.  (This helps us disambiguate requests to ensure there are as few duplicates as possible).
      </p>
      <p>
        The request "type" parameter should also be provided with a value of "article" or "data". If not provided the type defaults to "article".
      </p>
      <p>
        An "email" parameter should
        be provided having the email address of the author to contact about the request (we will try to find
        an email address if one is not provided).Ideally, a "story" parameter should also be provided having text explaining why the request is necessary. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "title" and "doi" parameters can also be provided as additional information about the resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid creating a request for a resource that is already available, please use the /availability endpoint to determine if the item is available or we already have an open request for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The response will be a JSON object of the new request, which will include the new request ID in the "_id" parameter.
      </p>

      <p>
        This endpoint allows you to flexibly search and explore availability of all URLs previously received.  These are indexed by an elasticsearch so some knowledge of straightforward elasticsearch search semantics is necessary.      </p>
          <p>
        A simple search can be created by adding a url parameter called "q" (for query) and provide values you would like to match. For example to find all availability checks made on the sciencedirect
        website by users of our v1.0.0 plugin with the query <code>?q=*sciencedirect* AND plugin:oabutton_1.0.0</code>
        Note that in a query, * can be used as a wildcard to match anything (in the example, before and after "sciendedirect").  Also note that AND, OR and other logic can be used to combine search values in a query.
      </p>
  	  <p>
        To make full use of this endpoint you should read the
        <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/query-dsl.html" target="_blank">elasticsearch query DSL documentation</a>
        (we are currently on ES 1.4, moving soon to 5.x).
