        <ul>
          <li>Start by getting the plugin for your browser.</li>
          <li>When you want access to an article or data that is not available, click the Open Access Button (you can do this on a paywall too).</li>
          <li>If we can't find the article or the data, you can create a request story to ask the author for access.</li>
          <li>(If someone already started a request for the same content, you can add your support to their request).</li>
          <li>Your request will be moderated before being sent to the author.</li> 
          <li>Once approved, we'll send your request, and you can use your request page to build support for your request.</li>
          <li>We'll follow up with the author and keep you in the loop about the progress (whether you started the request or added your support to a request).</li>
          <li>Once the requested content has been made available, we will mark the request as successful and let you know.</li>
          <li>You'll be able to verify the content is what you wanted!</li>
