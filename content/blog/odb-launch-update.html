<h1>Open Data Button Launch Update</h1>

<p>The Open Data Button has now soft launched. You can use the Button, see your requests and share them. After a few early hiccups (see tweets) we're now planning to push the Open Data Button out to people early next week. Stay tuned for more, especially our next post on Open Data Day.</p>
