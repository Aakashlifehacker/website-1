<h2 align="centre">Open Access Button Annual Report 2014</h2>

<p>We all know the frustration of not being able to afford $40 to access the article you need. Open Access is about providing free, immediate online  access to research articles. The Open Access Button helps you get the research you want right now, and adds papers you still need to your  wishlist.</p>
</br>
<p>
In 2014, fresh off the launch of the Open Access Button Beta, we had three goals and we were able to complete our primary goal for the year, redesigning and building the Button from the ground up has been achieved. You can now find us on Android,  Chrome, Firefox and in your bookmarks bar. The new tool is bigger and better with the capability to do all the usual scholar and CORE searches but now we are adding the capability to massively extend this functionality and do other things such email authors. To pretend it's perfect would be misleading, we've still got a  handful of big issues including our reliance on CORE for metadata and  the fact we're yet to turn on the ability to email authors. But, what we have now is something that we can now build upon and improve on over the next few months.
</p>
</br>
<p>In  2015 we will be improving the tool, getting the tool used and utilising the data and stories to fuel the movement and create real change. This  will include building a brand new data platform and a focus upon grassroots advocacy with a network of local ambassadors..</p>
