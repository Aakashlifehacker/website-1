Like research articles, research data is often not openly available, preventing you from building upon the research and making science reproducible. We are building an Open Data Button, so that you can request that data associated with a publication is made accessible. The Open Data Button will be integrated with the <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a> to facilitate data deposits.</p>  <p>All tools and services developed with these grant funds will have open licenses to maximize collaboration, reuse, and community support. These grants were made possible by an anonymous donation to the Center for Open Science, and we thank both the Center for Open Science and their anonymous donor for this grant.</p> <p>If you have any questions about this grant or would like to be amongst the first to test the new tool as part of our testing group, get in touch hello@openaccessbutton.org.</p> </br> </br> </br> </div>
