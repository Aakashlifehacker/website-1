  We're excited to say this week we'll release major updates for the Open Access Button and the Open Data Button for Firefox.
</p>

<p><a href="/blog/open-data-button-is-here"><b>NEW APP HELPS RESEARCHERS SHARE DATA OPENLY</b></a> (2016-03-07)<br>The Open Access Button today announces the beta release of the Open Data Button, a tool to help people find the data underlying research papers and request the release of new data. Every day, researchers cannot access the research data needed to verify results and build on others’ research. Open research data increases the reproducibility and transparency of research, and enables greater innovation. The Open Data Button app is available for Chrome and can be downloaded for free at opendatabutton.org. </p>
