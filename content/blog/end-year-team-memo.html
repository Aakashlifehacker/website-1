			<h1>End of Year Student Team Email</h1>
<p> Hi everyone, on behalf of the entire team I would like to wish you a very Happy New Year and I hope you all had an enjoyable holiday period. As we close out on 2014, I thought I would share an email Joe and I sent around the amazing Open Access Button student team a few weeks ago summarising our progress in 2014 and hinting at what is to come in 2015. For those of you reading, 2015 will be our biggest year yet (I am so excited) and I can't wait for you to join us on this journey. </p>

<p>See in you in very early 2015 :) </p>

	<p>Hi team,</p>
	<p>This may drag on a bit, so a quick spoiler alert. We're about to layout the progress on the project after the past few months, maybe get a little bit sentimental and then give y'all a choice. This is most definitely required reading.</p>
	<p>At the start of 2014, we had three goals and hopefully it escaped none of your attentions that our primary goal of the year (as set by us collectively), redesigning and building the Button from the ground up for a brighter future has been achieved. You can now find us on Android, Chrome, Firefox and in your bookmarks bar. Although this wasn't an explicit goal, we also made a new website for the Button too, just for fun. The new tool is bigger and better with the capability to do all the usual scholar and CORE searches but now the added capability to massively extend this functionality and do other things such email authors. To pretend it's perfect would be misleading, we've still got a handful of big issues including our reliance on CORE for meta data and the fact we're yet to turn on the ability to email authors. But, what we have now is something that we can now build upon and improve in the next year and we fully intend to do so. If it wasn't for the great work of Martin, Min, Vesko, Harry, Andy (Ubiquity Press) and Mark (Cottage Labs) we wouldn't have got this far.</p>
	<p>In January we sat in a room and discussed needing to sail a boat around the world to launch the Button (you had to be there), needless to say the Button Boat was kept at harbour but the launch was still impressive. In London, we packed a room with over 40 people for the Button's launch and livestreamed it to 150 more. Around the world, events during Open Access Week featured the Button and really expanded our reach. All this work was made possible by Chealsye, JISC and the event hosts.</p>
	<p>Since then, the community has continued to point to us as a great tool and a shining example of what can be done. Chealsye, Penny, Natalia, Sarah, Martin and Georgina can all vouch for how important people consider what we do!</p>
	<p>Despite this, we still have a long way to go and huge challenges ahead. Right now, we need to bring in some serious money to drive development of the tool and we need to focus on the next goals, to get the Button used and to start delivering the data, stories and anecdotes to the movement to drive change.</p>
	<p>Right now, those challenges look insurmountable - but so did the ones we faced this time last year.</p>
	<p>We've come an incredible distance since the launch of the Beta, and we could go on and on about the successes. To mention a few, we've rebuilt the tool, launched the new look, we've grown organisationally and all of this has put us in an incredible position to grow in the future. We've received great press coverage and praise from a diverse range of people. You should be incredibly proud of your work and how far you've made the Open Access Button come. We've also failed a lot, but lets sweep those under the rug, always keeping in mind the lessons learned from the failures.</p>
	<p>Despite all the success of the last year, it would be wrong to dismiss the challenges we've had and the responsibility for these challenges ultimately lies with us. As 2015 comes in, we'll be starting a new phase of planning for the Button, this new phase of planning will allow us to address some of the challenges we've had in bring people onboard the team and in how teams have worked. We'll be trying out new styles of planning, focussing on more iterative styles of planning, rather than the traditional, long term planning we have used to date. Teams and areas of work, and roles may all change, as we start to try these ideas out.</p>
	<p>At this stage, we want to acknowledge that we know you are all busy and many of you are juggling various commitments and may be going through transitions in your careers - and that many of you have stuck with us regardless. Because of that, if anyone wants to take the opportunity to leave the team, please feel free to take this opportunity.</p>
	<p>If you decide to leave, please email us off this thread and let us know. If you decide to go, we'll only ask one small thing of you, to have a short chat and let us know what went well, what didn't go well and how we can improve in the future. If you decide to stay, please email us off this thread and let us know. As the team moves into 2015, there'll be big challenges that require hard work but most importantly a renewed energy and commitment to facing the challenges ahead.</p>
	<p>Finally, with all that said, on a personal note (yes, we can speak as one person) - having each and every one of you join us on this journey has meant the world to us. We've been lucky enough to, while building a button, also build friendships, memories, and truly, more than any lines of code that is what will make this a success.</p>
	<p>Happy Holidays, and we look forward to starting a new chapter with you all January 1st.</p>
	<p>Joe and David</p>
