<p>Friends,</p>
<p>You have not heard from us in recent months but quietly in the background we have continued working hard. We have been overcoming challenges, applying for several grants and reviewing how we work to be as effective as we can be over the coming years.  Over the upcoming year, our work will focus on improving the tool, expanding our user base and using the data and stories for data-driven campaigns. You will hear more about that soon.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, we have made so much progress but we know we have so much more to do. The hardest work, the work of maintaining, improving the tool and using the data and stories to drive advocacy is still to be done.</p>
<p>Today, you can support our work, join #teambutton by <a href="http://elevator.jisc.ac.uk/e/2-startup-projects/idea/open-access-button">voting for us in the Jisc Supporting Technology Startup Projects competition</a>. We have applied to develop a much requested feature allowing users to generate automatic emails asking an author to make their paper available through a repository. This major expansion in 2015 would improve the tool and we hope increase current and historical access to research.</p>
<p>With this new feature, we hope to attract more users to the Open Access Button. The qualitative and quantitative data generated can support efforts by Open Access advocates to improve the scholarly publishing system in the future.</p>
<p>With much more to come in the next months, today, you can support our Jisc grant application by voting for us <a href="http://elevator.jisc.ac.uk/e/2-startup-projects/idea/open-access-button">here</a> and sharing it on social media.</p>
