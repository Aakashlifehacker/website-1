          <h2>Hurrah, thanks for trying InstantILL!</h2>
          <p>
            You just put an title into InstantILL, and we found a version that's Open Access, so you can go straight to the full text.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built this into the heart of InstantILL because patrons want to access content instantly, and often more than 20% of ILLs can be found Open Access, saving you money and time. We’ve been pioneers in delivery Open Access, and our content comes only from legal aggregators, such as Unpaywall, DOAJ, and many more.

            Since this a demo, we can't really make an ILL for you, so we're showing you all the article meta-data we'd pass to you instead. You can set-up InstantILL to point to your existing ILL form, where you can handle authentication and submission into your existing systems, or of course, submit it over email.
          </p>
          <p>
            We just made sure that patrons don't need to complete a long form, and when it arrives, you have everything you need to send the request for fulfilment.

            InstantILL knows the electronic resources you subscribe to, and can make sure patrons see them before making a request. If you have access, InstantILL will provide a direct link for the user to access through your proxy. Off campus, they’ll be nudged to login to access the content.</p>
          <p>
            Since this a demo, we're just linking you to an Open Access version of an article, but you get the idea!
          </p>
          <p>
            InstantILL can also be integrated inside your library search, and link resolver worflows in a couple of different ways.

            InstantILL can work like a link resolver, so you can link to it and it can be embedded into link resolvers and let patrons know what they can get. This makes it a great replacement in 'request a copy' buttons, or for embedding into link resolvers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the article we tested there isn't available there, so all you can do is submit an Interlibrary Loan.

<!-- functions you can trigger:

Put a div with ID "instantill" in the place where you want the instantill demo to show up. Note this can only appear in one place at a time.

The page tries to execute a login on page load.
If it succeeds it will try to replace the content of any element on the page with the "yourid" class with the user ID.
It will also try to replace "but only you" in the content of any element with the "onlyyou" class with "but only you (USERNAME)".
And it will look for any section with the class "yourid" and will replace any text that contains instantill() with the instantill({SETTINGS})
suitable for the logged in user (their user ID).

It will then go through any ILL config present for the logged in user, and for every value, it will look for an element on the page with the matching ID,
and it will place the value of that config item as the value of the element (note as described below for saving, such elements should also have the "setting" class).
(if it is a boolean value the element should be a checkbox, and it will be checked or not depending on boolean value).

Any button with the "view" class will cause the UI view to change between divs with the "section" class.
The "view" class button goes to the next "section" div by default. If you also give the button the "previous" class it goes to the previous one.
If the "view" button has an href that is longer than 1 then the href value is assumed to be the ID of the div to show, or a classname for a set of things to show.
Any execution of a "view" button first hides all "section" divs then shows the previous or next or defined things.

If you want the section that you switch to with the "view" button to show the #instantill demo in it, you
can add the "pull" class to the button. Then, once the view has switched to the specified section, the #instantill
demo div will be appended to the content section of the currently visible section.

Any button ("button" or "a" link tag) that has the "save" class will trigger a save
A save will look for any element with the "setting" class and will take the value of that element and try to use it as the config value corresponding to the ID of that element.
If the save button also has an attr called "preview" then it can be set to true to trigger an instantill preview run with a default value
If preview attr is set but is some value other than true, then the value of the preview attr will be used in the instantill box

Any button with the "preview" class will trigger the instantill box with a trial value. The value should be specified on the button
in an attr called "val" or else the html content of the button will be used as the value.

NOTE: if you want the view to change when a preview is triggered, put the view class BEFORE the preview class.
That way the view will change, the preview will run, and if the preview is not visible it will be pulled forward
into the view you have changed to.
