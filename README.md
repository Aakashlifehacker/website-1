## How to Edit
So your steps should be:
1. make some changes in Develop
2. commit them in Develop
3. pull from Develop to check in case Chealsye or someone else made changes
4. If all OK, push to Develop
5. View on the test site
6. checkout master
7. pull from master
merge Develop
push to master
Although before point 6 you probably could do other pushes to Develop and view them too. Most of the time it should work
These occasional conflicts are slightly annoying when they occur, but it is still far better than versions of docs flying all over the place anyway!
