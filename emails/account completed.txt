{{SUBJECT Start Using Your Open Access Button!}}

Hi {{username}},

Thanks for using the Open Access Button. You're one step closer to accessing the articles and data you need.

You can find and request research right now with the Browser Button at https://www.openaccessbutton.org/request/new. Open Access Button plugins for Chrome and Firefox will be released in the next two weeks. We'll also release a bookmarklet for all browsers during that time. We'll send you an update when the plugin is available for installation. 

You can track your ongoing requests under your account at https://www.openaccessbutton.org/account. If you experience any problems using the Button, let us know!

We look forward to getting you access to research,
The Open Access Button team
