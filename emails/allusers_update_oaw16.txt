{{SUBJECT Update Your Open Access Button!}}

Hi!

We have exciting news - there's a new Open Access Button. You can update your Button right now through your account page: https://openaccessbutton.org/account/. Your current Button will stop working.

There are some big changes. Here are just four:
1. You can find and request both articles and data in one service. The system we use to find articles has had dramatic improvements.
2. The request system has major improvements. We'll now try and find author's emails for you & approve requests in less than a day.
3. The bookmarklet is back.
4. You can use the button from a webpage.

and throughout everything is simpler, more efficient, and better.

Once you update your Button, give it a try and let us know what you think!

Learn more about the changes in our blog post: https://openaccessbutton.org/blog/new-oab-2016

We look forward to continuing to get you access to research,

The Open Access Button team
