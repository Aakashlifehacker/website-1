{{SUBJECT Thank you for sharing your research!}}

<p>Dear colleague,</p>

<p>
  Thanks for trying to make the paper available! Unfortunately, the file you sent us looks like a publisher’s PDF and can’t be shared legally for free as the journal doesn’t allow that. Since this is the final version that the publisher hosts, and type-set, they only let it be shared in limited ways (which may be at the expense of potential readers, citations, and impact for you!). If you have explicit permission from the journal to share this version, that’s wonderful, just let us know and attach proof (e.g., the contract or an email).
</p>
<p>
  To help make the correct version available you can find information about article versions, including what they look like and how to find them <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c3OUNmGtWcW0_zqb3Z9vJehQpzckJLni1aG0SBBPNUQ/edit?usp=sharing">in our short explainer</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Let me know how else we can help, or if you can’t share your article at the moment, let us know that too.
</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>
