{{SUBJECT Request to share your research}}

<p>Dear colleague,</p>

<p>We are writing to you from the <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org">Open Access Button</a>, a tool helping connect people with research articles and data they cannot access.</p>

<p>One of our users, {{fullname}}, who is a {{profession}} is interested in an article you published - "<a href "{{url}}">{{title}}</a>". But they need access to the {{type}} and has <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/request/{{_id}}">publicly requested that you share it</a>. They need it because "{{story}}".</p>

<p>Our users are just some of many who would benefit if you shared the research openly. Sharing your {{type}} could lead to increased citations for your work <a href ="https://peerj.com/articles/175/">[1]</a> <a href="http://sparceurope.org/oaca/">[2]</a>, the acceleration of research in your area <a href ="http://www.icsu.org/general-assembly/31st-general-assembly-auckland-2014/news/ICSU%20Report%20on%20Open%20Access.pdf">[1]</a> and <a href ="https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800">a host of other benefits</a>. You'll also get fewer requests for your {{type}} in future.</p>

<p>You can make your {{type}} publicly available by uploading it, or if it is already publicly available by providing a URL. <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}">You can do both those things here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you've made the work available we will send it to {{fullname}} and anyone else who needs it, and thank you with a digital badge or public recognition.</p>

<p>We know you're probably extremely busy. If you need <a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=3days"> a few days</a>, <a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=7days">a week</a>, or even <a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=28days">a month</a> to respond just click those links and we'll let {{fullname}} know. You can also refuse the request entirely by clicking <a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?refuse=true">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any issues, questions, or want to talk to someone just reply to this message. We'd love to hear from you.</p> 
  
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>The Open Access Button Robot</p>
