{{SUBJECT Request to share your research}}

<p>Dear colleague,</p>

<p>We are writing to you from Open Access Button, a tool helping connect people
with research articles they can't access and the data behind them.</p>

<p>One of our users, {{fullname}}, who's a {{profession}} is interested in an article you published - "<a href "{{url}}">{{title}}</a>". But, they would like access to the {{type}} and has <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/request/{{_id}}">publicly requested that you share it</a>. They need it because "{{story}}".</p>

<p>Our users are just some of many who would benefit if you shared the research openly. Sharing your {{type}} could <a href ="">lead to increased citations for your work</a>, the <a href ="">acceleration of research in your area</a> and <a href ="https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800">a host of other benefits</a>. You'll also get fewer requests for your {{type}} in future.</p>

<p>You can make your {{type}} publicly available by simply uploading
your {{type}}, or if it is already publicly available by just providing a URL where we can find it. <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}">You can do both those things here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you've uploaded or provided a link the community will celebrate your efforts <i>(a rubbish piece of copy trying to reference a badge without being specific)!</i></p>

<p>We know you're probably extremely busy. If you need <a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=7days"> a few days,</a>, <a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=14days"> a week,</a>, or even <a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=28days">a month</a></a> to respond just click those links and we'll let {{fullname}} know. You can also refuse the request entirely by clicking <a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?refuse=true">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any issues, questions, or just want to talk to someone email us at <a href="mailto:requests@openaccessbutton.org">requests@openaccessbutton.org</a>. We'd love to hear from you. Kind Regards,</p>

<p>The Open Access Button Robot</p>
