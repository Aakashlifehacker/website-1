{{SUBJECT Request to share your data}}

<p>Dear colleague,</p>

<p>We are writing to you from Open Access Button, a tool helping connect people
with research articles and the data behind them!</p>

<p>One of our users, {{fullname}}, who's a {{profession}} is interested in research you published:</p>

<p>{{title}}</p>

<p>and they would like access to the {{type}}, if at all possible,
and have publicly requested that you share it. They need access to it because:</p>

<p>"{{story}}"</p>

<p>Our users are just some of many who would benefit if you shared the
{{type}}. Sharing your {{type}} could lead to increased citations for your work,
and the acceleration of research in your area.</p>

<p>You can easily make your {{type}} publicly available by simply uploading
your {{type}} in your preferred format, or if it is already publicly available
by just providing a URL where we can find it. Just go to our <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}">upload page</p>.

<p>We'll use the Open Science Framework to host, preserve, and identify your {{type}}. We'll use the paper title and abstract to provide initial metadata and licence
the data CC0 (the recommended licence for sharing data).</p>

<p>We know preparing to share your {{type}} can take some time, and you're probably extremely busy, so you can put this request on hold if necessary.</p>

<p>You can tell us how long you need by just clicking the corresponding link below:</p>

<p><a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=7days">I need 7 days</a></p>
<p><a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=14days">I need 14 days</a></p>
<p><a href ="https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=28days">I need 28 days</a></p>

<p>Or if you want to refuse to provide this {{type}}, click this link:</p>

<p>https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?refuse=true</p>

<p>Once you've uploaded or provided a link, our community will confirm it and then you'll receive an Open Data Badge badge to recognise your efforts!</p>

<p>If you have any other issues, email us at requests@openaccessbutton.org.</p>

<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>The Open Access Button Robot</p>
