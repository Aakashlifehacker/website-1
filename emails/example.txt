{{SUBJECT I am the subject of this email /SUBJECT}}

Hello there!

I am an example email that could be sent by the Open Access Buttons system.

I am just a simple plain text email so far, with some novel ways to provide or include variables. 
As a plain text email, I should have the filename suffix .txt

I can be written in html instead of just text, in which case I should be formatted 
using html content rather than just text.

To turn me into an html template, just put the usual html in here, and change the suffix of 
the filename to .html instead of .txt

Markdown is NOT possible yet, but if it would be useful, it could be added. In that case, the 
file should contain markdown and the suffix should be changed to .md

If this email content should include variables that should be inserted by the system before sending, 
then they can be included like this: {{VARIABLE}}

Which variables can be included like this is an open question - perhaps they could be variables from 
an oabutton request, or variables from an oabutton user account. We should discuss this. Where emails 
can be written as generically as possible, this is the best solution. But for example an email to a user 
or group of users about a particular request would need to use a variable to include a URL that points 
to the request in question, something like https://openaccessbutton.org/request/{{_id}}

To provide variables in this template that should be used by the system sending this email, 
include them like the example SUBJECT variable shown at the top of this email. At the moment, 
the only valid variable that can be passed to the system this way is SUBJECT. If you find the 
need for a new variable, open an issue about it on oabutton/backend/issues.

Thanks!


The lovely Open Access Button system
