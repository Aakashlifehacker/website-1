{{SUBJECT I am the subject of this email}}

Hello there!

I am an example email that could be sent by the Open Access Buttons system.

I am just a simple plain text email so far, with some novel ways to provide or include variables. 
As a plain text email, I should have the filename suffix .txt

I can be written in html instead of just text, in which case I should be formatted 
using html content rather than just text.

To turn me into an html template, just put the usual html in here, and change the suffix of 
the filename to .html instead of .txt

Markdown is NOT possible yet, but if it would be useful, it could be added. In that case, the 
file should contain markdown and the suffix should be changed to .md

If this email content should include variables that should be inserted by the system before sending, 
then they can be included like this: {{VARIABLE}}

The variables that are available in a request context are:

{{_id}} (the ID of the request)
{{url}} (the URL of the page the request was created on)
{{title}} (the title of the article the request is about)
{{story}} (the story of why the user created the request)
{{type}} (the type of request - article OR data)
{{status}} (the status of the request)
{{count}} (how many people want this content)
{{userid}} (the user ID of the user that created the request)
{{username}} (the username of the user that created the request)
{{receiver}} (the receiver token necessary in a URL to allow an author to submit content to the request)

Using a variable in context would look something like https://openaccessbutton.org/request/{{_id}}

And in a user context are:

{{userid}}
{{username}}
{{useremail}}
{{fullname}}
{{affiliation}}
{{profession}}
{{logincode}}
{{loginurl}}

(Also see the author_request example for a fuller demonstration of an actual email template the system could send.)

Emails should be written as generically as possible, so they fit as many logical flows as can be allowed, 
and must fit a context in which the system can know to send them. When emailing a group of users, for 
example all users that supported a request, the email they all receive should be the same.

The two main types of context are changes to a request record and changes to a user record. 
Within those contexts, the most common is changes to a request record, and emails could be sent for example 
to a user after they create the request but when there are some key fields missing (status help), or when 
a request should be sent to an author to provide content (status progress) - and probably most status changes. 
Other triggers are followup actions, such as following up weekly for three weeks after a request is set to 
status hold, and on fourth week changing to status refused (or the author refuses) so then we send an email 
to the request creator to tell them it has been refused.

Email addresses to which we can send emails are the emails of users that created requests, emails of users 
that supported requests, emails of authors that are provided as contacts for requests, or the user account 
email address when contacting the user - but for the time being the decision on the emails to use will be 
set by the system; this may be updated in future.

Variables can also be PROVIDED to the system within an email template, so taht the system can use them when 
sending the email. The main example of this is the SUBJECT variable, which is demonstrated at the top of this 
email example. These are similar to including variables, but should be capitalised and after the variable 
name there should be a space and then the value for the variable.

The list of variables that can be provided:

{{SUBJECT I am an example subject variable}}

To request new variables either for inclusion or provision, create a github issue demonstrating the need 
for it in the context of a proposed or current template.

For development, any emails sent from the dev system will automatically replace https://openaccessbutton.org 
with https://oab.test.cottagelabs.com.

Thanks!


The lovely Open Access Button system
