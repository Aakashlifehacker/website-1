{{SUBJECT Update Your Open Access Button for major improvements!}}

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>We have exciting news - there's a new Open Access Button. You can update your Button right now through your account page: https://openaccessbutton.org/account/. Your current Button may stop working.</p>

<p>There are some big improvements. Here are just four:
<ol>
<li>You can find and request both articles and data in one service. The system we use to find articles has also had dramatic improvements.</li>
<li>The request system has major improvements. We'll now try to find author's emails for you and approve requests in less than a day.</li>
<li>The bookmarklet is back, so we once again support all browsers.</li>
<li>You can use the Button from a web page.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>and throughout everything is simpler, more efficient, and better.</p>

<p>Once you update your Button, give it a try and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>Learn more about the changes in our blog post: https://openaccessbutton.org/blog/new-oab-2016</p>

<p>We look forward to continuing to get you access to research,</p>
<p>The Open Access Button team</p>
