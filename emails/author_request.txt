{{SUBJECT Open Access Button request to share}}

Dear colleague,

We are writing to you from Open Access Button, a tool helping connect people 
with research articles and the data behind them!

{{count}} of our users are interested in an article you published:

{{title}}

and they would like access to the {{type}}, if at all possible, 
and have publicly requested that you share it.

Our users are just some of many who would benefit if you shared the 
{{type}}, and you can read stories about why our users would like access 
on the public request page at:

https://openaccessbutton.org/request/{{_id}}

Sharing your {{type}} could lead to increased citations for your work, 
and the acceleration of research in your area.

You can easily make your {{type}} publicly available by simply uploading 
your {{type}} in your preferred format, or if it is already publicly available 
by just providing a URL where we can find it. Just go to our upload page by 
following the link below:

https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}

We'll use the Open Science Framework to host, preserve, and identify your data. 

We'll use the paper title and abstract to provide initial metadata and licence 
the data CC0 (the recommended licence for sharing data).

We know preparing to share your {{type}} can take some time, and you're probably extremely busy, so you can put this request on hold if necessary.

You can tell us how long you need by just clicking the corresponding link below:

https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=7days
https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=14days
https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?hold=28days

Or if you want to refuse to provide this {{type}}, click this link:

https://openaccessbutton.org/response/{{receiver}}?refuse=true

Once you've uploaded or provided a link, our community will confirm it and then you'll receive a badge to recognise your efforts!

If you have any other issues, email us at contact@openaccessbutton.org.

Kind Regards,


The Open Access Button Robot
