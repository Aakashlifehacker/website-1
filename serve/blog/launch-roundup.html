<h1>Open Access Button Launch Roundup</h1>
<p>After  hundreds of hours, many sleepless nights and a whole lot of coffee we launched the new Open Access Button two weeks ago in London, this launch event was central to an entire week of events all throughout Open Access Week as amazing activists all over the world held Open Access Button  launch events in the UK, USA, Brunei, Nepal and India to name but a few.  If you missed it you can catch footage from the London event on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpx3rzdbZ4c">Youtube</a></p>.

<p>There have been pieces on the Open Access Button in the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/will-ross/new-app-makes-research-ac_b_6019428.html">Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/23/open-access-button-gets-expanded-features-to-help-users-find-free-scholarly-researc/">Venture Beat</a>, <a href = "http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43858?utm_campaign=sm&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitter1"> Creative Commons </a>, <a href = "http://okfn.gr/2014/10/openaccessbutton/">Open Knowledge Greece</a>, <a href = "http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/blog/openaccess/2014/10/22/open-access-button/">Imperial College blogs</a> <a href = "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/students-re-launch-open-access-button-apps-find-free-access-scientific-and">, Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, <a href = "http://blog.okfn.org/2014/10/22/new-open-access-button-launches-as-part-of-open-access-week/">  Open Knowledge Foundation Blog </a>. Other highlights included the launch events all over world and our Open Access Week <a href = "http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2k3zy8/we_are_eff_creative_commons_right_to_research/">reddit AMA </a> alongside EFF, Creative Commons, the Right to Research Coalition and Fundacion Karisma.</p>
<h2>How the Open Access Button works</h2>
</br>
<h3>Push Button.</h3>
<div align="center"><img src="https://openaccessbutton.org/static/button.png"></div>
</br>
Download the Open Access Button from <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/">openaccessbutton.org</a>.The  next time you're asked to pay to access academic research. Push the  Open Access Button on your phone or on the web.
</br>
<h3>Get Research.</h3>
<div align="center"><img src="https://openaccessbutton.org/static/research.png"></div>
</br>
The  Open Access Button will search the web for version of the paper that  you can access immediately. If that doesn't work, the Button will email  the author and look for more information about the paper.
</Br>
<h3>Make Progress.</h3>
<div align="center"><img src="https://openaccessbutton.org/static/progress.png"></div>
</br>
If  you get your research, you can make progress with your work. If you  don't get your research, we will add the paper to your wishlist and  continue to look for a copy, if we eventuallly find one, we'll email you  with a copy of the paper. In addtion, your story will be used to help change the publishing system so it doesn't happen again.
</br>
</br>
<p>  If you head to the Open Access Button site, you can sign up. It only takes a second, sign up with an email and username. and then you'll be  taken to your userpage. There you can find all the available apps to download.
</br>
<h2>Here's how it works behind the scenes</h2>

<h3>Finding free papers:</h3>
</br>
Versions  of papers published in journals that require you to pay to read can  sometimes be accessed for free in other places. These other copies are  often very similar to the published version, but may lack nice  formatting or be a version prior to peer review. These copies can be  found archived in research repositories, on authors websites and many other places. To find these versions we identify the  paper a user needs and effectively search on Google Scholar and CORE to find these copies and link them to the users. We are always looking to  integrate more repositories and if you can help get in touch.

<h3>Making more research, or information about papers available:</h3>
Much of the time, there won't be a copy available, if a copy of a research  paper isn't available we aim to make one available. This is not a simple  task and so we have to use a few different innovative strategies. One of these is that we are aiming to create a new incentive for authors to put  their work in repositories (faciliating "Green" Open Access). By emailing the author, and creating pages which can get their attention we  hope to help the voices of those needing their research need them.  We'll make it easy for researchers to deposit research (they have the right to deposit) in established repositories or on the web, and when  researchers do make copies available somewhere on the web, we'll email  you the copy of the research you needed access to.
</br>
</br>
Overall, the Open Access Button will represent an increasingly powerful way to  link published research in journals to research in research  repositories. Research repositories store a huge number of papers, but  can often can be hard to find and use, this new platform will allow us  to aid their discoverability. While we're talking about how it works,  it's worth mentioning while we wish we could say to you all that everything is working flawlessly, we can't. Like all first releases, the first few weeks will be a slightly bumpy start. You will try and use the tool in ways we could not have imagined, in setups we couldn't test for so we will be very quickly listening to you all and responding to bugs.
</br>
<h2>Advocacy</h2>
<p>Unfortunately the Open Access Button can only do so much, and isn't a perfect or long  term solution to this problem. We have to start using the data and the  stories collected by the Open Access Button to help make the changes  required to really solve this issue. We will be running campaigns and  supporting grassroots advocates with this at <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/action/">our Action Centre</a> as well as building a dedicated data platform for  advocates to use our data. If you go to our Action Centre, you now you  can see the ready to be filled map, and your first action, sign our  <a href="https://act.eff.org/action/let-s-stand-together-to-promote-open-access-worldwide">first  petition</a>, this petition in support of Diego Gomez, a student  who faces 8 years in prison and a huge monetary fine for doing something  citizens do everyday, sharing research online for those who cannot  access it.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>
<p>The final thing left is the thank everyone who made this possible. It would be wrong for us to talk about the Open Access Button without giving proper mention to the community that has built up around it, and the broader Open Access community that  
has supported it since day one. We have really found a home in the  community, and to a certain extent now almost feel like we have grown up  in it, as individuals, and as a team. After we released the beta, the  community contributed to a consultation exercise to ensure we built what  was right for them. When it came time to fund the Open Access Button, we again  turned to the community for help and found a huge amount of support, but  not quite enough to meet our goals, which in all fairness were set sky  high. This is where our key partnership with <a href="http://www.cottagelabs.com/">Cottage  Labs</a>, a small UK development house providing social and technical solutions to complex problems again demonstrated how important  the community has been. In partnership with them and our lead developer  Mark, we have built the core elements of the tool which power the Open Access Button. They stepped in because they cared about the project, and  saw a bright future and without them I can very much say we would not be here.

<p>It does not end there though, Harry and Vesko, our mobile app developers,  the best developers in the Young Rewired state group - have done an  outstanding job and the developer of the Chrome app, Andy Byers from  Ubiquity Press really helped us out in the final few days and was  allowed time to work on the Button prior to launch. There is countless others that we do not have the space nor the memory to thank but you can find a longer list of people thanked on our <a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/about#thanks/">thank  you</a> page. The 20 other launch events across the world  showcasing the Open Access Button as part of Open Access Week perfectly shows the community in action.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>
What is being released here is the platform for the future, it is now built in a  scalable and sustainable way and to allow it to grow, adapt and  improve. Backed by the core elements of the technology, and the  continued support of the community our potential to do cool new things  is greater now than ever. To name just a few we are looking forward to:

<ul>
  <li>Delivering the facts about papers to our users to give summaries of research</li>
  <li>Automatic recognition of paywalls to make users lives easier</li>
  <li>Adding in more sources of free papers through more repositories and facilitating green open access</li>
  <li>Expanding to a few extra platforms, including other browsers and potentially repositories themselves</li>
  <li>Building out more interesting ways of telling stories and using our data to create change</li>
  <li>Working with Wikipedia to help mark references on wikipedia as open access</li>
  <li>Creating tools for librarians to help manage their subscription budgets</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay  tuned over the next few months for what is coming next. Until then, there are still exciting opportunities for you to make a difference, you  just have to push the Button.</p>
