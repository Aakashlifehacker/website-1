                            <p>In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5rVH1KGBCY" target="_blank">Open Access Explained!</a>, Nick Shockey (Right to Research Coalition) and Jonathan Eisen (Biologist at University of California, Davis) explain open access, with animations by Jorge Cham of PhD comics.</p>
                            <p>Open Access is the free, immediate online availability of research articles. Currently scholarly research articles are often only accessible through expensive journal subscriptions also called "paywalls". Open Access aims to remove this access barrier and for knowledge to be freely accessed and shared by all.</p>
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('what2')"><h3>Why Open Access?</h3></a>
                        <div id="what2" style="display:none;">
                            <p>We engage and invest in research in order to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, encourage innovation, enrich education, and stimulate the economy - to improve the public good.  Communication of the results of research is an essential component of the research process; research can only advance by sharing the results, and the value of an investment in research is only maximized through wide use of its results.</p>
                            <p>Yet, too often, because of cost barriers or use restrictions, research results are not available to the full community of potential users.  The Internet gives us the opportunity to bring this crucial information to a worldwide audience at virtually no marginal cost, and allows us to use it in new, innovative ways. This has resulted in a call for new framework to allow research results to be more easily accessed and used - the call for Open Access.</p>

                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('what3')"><h3>How Does Open Access Work?</h3></a>
                        <div id="what3" style="display:none;">
                            <p>Open Access Button considers the terms outlined by the Creative Common's Attribution-Only license (CC-BY) to be the standard terms for Open Access.</p>
                            <p>There are four primary mechanisms that can be used to enable Open Access:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Open Access Publishing:</em><br/>
                                Authors can choose to publish their research articles in a growing number of journals that meet the full definition of Open Access.  Articles are free to all interested readers, and the publishers place no financial or copyright barriers between the readers and the article.  Open Access publishing is the fastest growing segment of the scholarly publishing market, and journal options are now available for nearly every area of research. A comprehensive list of Open Access journals is provided by the <a href="http://doaj.org" target="_blank">Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)</a>.
                                <li><em>Digital Repositories:</em><br/>
                                Authors can choose to deposit their research articles in digital archives (often called Digital Repositories or Institutional Repositories) which conform to the standards of the Open Archives Initiative (OAI), and enable readers to freely access and fully reuse the article text.  This allows any author to make their work available under Open Access conditions regardless of the journal out the article is published in.  There are more than 2,000 open Digital Repositories available for authors to use around the world, and a comprehensive listing of is available through the <a href="http://www.opendoar.org/" target="_blank">Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR)</a>.
                                <li><em>Effectively Managed Author Rights:</em><br/>
                                As the authors of a research paper, you have ability to ensure that your article can be accessed and used by the widest possible audience.  Tools such as Addenda to traditional Copyright Transfer Forms are readily available, proven resources that can help you understand open licenses, and to publish your articles under full Open Access conditions. <a href="http://sparc.arl.org/resources/authors/addendum" target="_blank">Visit the SPARC Author Rights page to learn more</a>.
                                <li><em>Local, National and International Open Access Policies:</em><br/>
                                Institutions that support research, from public and private research funders to higher education institutions, can implement effective policies that that support making Open Access to scholarly research articles the default mode for their researchers. <a href="http://sparc.arl.org/initiatives/advocacy" target="_blank">Learn more about these policies on the SPARC Advocacy page</a>.

                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('what4')"><h3>Why Should You Care About Open Access?</h3></a>
                        <div id="what4" style="display:none;">
                            <p>Over the past decade, Open Access has become central to advancing the interests of researchers, scholars, students, businesses, and the public - as well as librarians.  The digital environment poses new challenges and provides new opportunities in the sharing, review, and publication of research results. Ensuring broad, unfettered access to the knowledge contained in primary research articles and the rights to use these articles fully will play a key role in seeing that the scholarly communication system evolves in a way that supports the needs of scholars and the academic enterprise as a whole.</p>
                            <p>Increasingly, institutions that support research - from public and private research funders to higher education institutions - are implementing policies that require researchers to make articles that report on research generated from their funding openly accessible to and fully useable by the public.</p>

                        <h1>Open Access Myths and Misunderstandings</h1>
                        <p>There are a number of common misunderstandings about Open Access. The following are some of the more common. Hopefully this guide will clear them up and make things easier.</p>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis1')"><h3>"There is one definition of Open Access"</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis1" style="display:none;">
                            There are many about what 'Open Access' means. At the Open Access Button we endorse the Budapest Open Access Initiative definition. So by "Open Access" to this literature, we mean its "free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited".
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis2')"><h3>"All Open Access is Gold Open Access."</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis2" style="display:none;">
                            As outlined by the Budapest Open Access Initiative, "Gold" Open Access is one of two strategies to achieve Open Access. Open Access delivered by journals is called "gold" Open Access and Open Access delivered by repositories is called "green" Open Access. Most  university or funding agencies has a policy requiring deposit in an Open Access repository rather than submission to Open Access journals.
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis3')"><h3>"Open Access is not peer reviewed."</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis3" style="display:none;">
                            <p>No, the Open Access movement is focusing on open-access for peer-reviewed literature. The goal is to remove access barriers, not changing the quality of research.</p>
                            <p>A journal's economic or access policy does not determine its peer review policy. Open Access journals can use the same peer review procedures, quality, processes and systems are the same as traditional journals. If traditional journals convert to Open Access, the quality of peer review doesn't change. The key variables in journal quality are the quality of authors, the quality of editors, and the quality of referees, all of which are independent of the journal's price or medium.</p>
                            <p>There are "predatory" publishers, do not publish with them. You can find advice on how to spot predatory publishers elsewhere in our advocacy guide.</p>
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis4')"><h3>"Green Open Access is about bypassing peer review."</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis4" style="display:none;">
                            <p>Open Access repositories do not provide their own peer review, but they can and do host articles peer-reviewed elsewhere. Policies requiring green Open Access actively call for Open Access to peer-reviewed manuscripts.</p>
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis5')"><h3>"Open Access journals are of low quality"</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis5" style="display:none;">
                            Thomson Scientific found that in every field of the sciences "there was at least one Open Access title that ranked at or near the top of its field" in citation impact. The number of high-quality Open Access journals has only grown since then. The quality of a scholarly journal, whether Open Access or not Open Access, is a function of its authors, editors, and referees.
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis6')"><h3>"Open Access journals are "free""</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis6" style="display:none;">
                            No.  Open Access journals and articles are not "free" in the sense of "free lunch"; they do aim to be free, however, in the sense of "free speech". Providing Open Access to research is not without cost, but research should be accessible to readers without barriers. Any costs involving editing, refereeing, producing, and distributing a journal can be managed in a any what does not involve the reader paying.
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis7')"><h3>"All Open Access journals charge publication fees"</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis7" style="display:none;">
                            Charging Article processing charges (APCs) is the best known model for Open Access journals, but it is a commonly held misconception that gold open access always equals payment, at the time of writing 6,447 journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals did not charge for publishing in their journal. Of those that do there are a lot of journals that provide discounts to for article processing charges or no questions asked waivers. Please contact individual journals for more details about waivers and discounts.
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis8')"><h3>"Authors always pay article processing charges"</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis8" style="display:none;">
                            <p>According to the Study of Open Access Publishing (SOAP), when researchers publish in fee-based Open Access journals, the fees are paid by funders (59%) or by universities (24%). Only 12% of the time are they paid by authors out of pocket.</p>
                            <p>If scholars decide to make their work available by the self archiving route, they never pay a fee to do so.</p>
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis9')"><h3>"Publication fees at Open Access journals are just subscriptions in disguise."</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis9" style="display:none;">
                            <p>This misunderstanding ignores the fact that publication fees at fee-based Open Access journals pay for the free, immediate online availability with full re-use rights, which is the whole point.  Subscriptions don't buy that.</p>
                            <p>Article Processing Charges in those journals that charge them buy access for everyone with an internet connection, including those who aren't paying fees, while subscriptions pay only for private use and consumption.</p>
                        </div>
                        <a href="javascript:ReverseDisplay('mis10')"><h3>"Open Access publishing deprives authors of royalties."</h3></a>
                        <div id="mis10" style="display:none;">
                            Journals don't pay authors for their work and generally don't pay editors and referees who facilitate peer review either. In addition to this, money charged for subscriptions does not go back to fund academic work.

                            Researchers in Southampton have shown that self-archiving takes about 10 minutes per paper. For scholars who publish a paper a month, and who have an average amount of help from co-authors, librarians, students, or assistants, self-archiving takes less than 40 minutes per year.

                            No. There are high impact factor open access journals in a wide range of disciplines. You can review the Directory of Open Access Journals or search for them in Ulrich's, and then review the titles' impact factors using three different measures. Impact Factor is regarded as a flawed metric for assessing impact, read Stephen Curry's "Sick of Impact Factors" for a critical analysis.

                            This misunderstanding is the result of extensive cross-breeding among other misunderstandings. The idea behind it is this: the best work generally winds up in the best journals, where it has the best chance of being seen. At least it should be steered toward the best journals, where it will have the best chance of being seen. When we add the suggestion that this path doesn't allow OA, or that OA can't improve upon it, then an idea that was largely true becomes completely false. It assumes that the best journals are never OA; that only journals can deliver OA; that the best journals never allow OA archiving; and that OA archiving can't increase the visibility and impact of work published in the best journals.

                            Open Access is the free immediate online availability to peer reviewed academic research with full re-use rights.</p>
                            <p><em>Longer Answer:</em></br>
                            By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.</p>

                            Many support Open Access to research because they believe the results of tax-payer funded research should be shared; since citizens have paid for this research, they should be able to access it at no additional charge. Many others also support Open Access to academic research because knowledge itself, or information, is a public good.

                            Charging Article processing charges (APCs) is the best known model for Open Access journals, but it is a commonly held misconception that gold open access always equals payment, at the time of writing 6,447 journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals did not charge for publishing in their journal.

                            <p><em>Longer Answer:</em></br>
                            According to the comprehensive Study of Open Access Publishing (SOAP), when researchers publish in fee-based open access journals, the fees are paid by funders (59%) or by universities (24%). Only 12% of the time are they paid by authors out of pocket. This is a good reason to stop using the term "author fees" for publication fees, or the term "author pays" for the fee-based business model.</p>
                            <p>Scholars who make their work green open access rather than gold never pay a fee to do so. Even when they choose the gold route, only 33% of peer-reviewed open access journals charge author-It follows that only 4% of authors who publish in open access journals (12% of 33%) pay fees out of pocket. At the same time, about 50% of articles published in peer-reviewed open access journals are published in fee-based journals. If we count by article rather than by journal, then only 6% of authors who publish in open access journals (12% of 50%) pay fees out of pocket.</p>

                            <p><em>Simple Answer:</em></br>
                            No, depending on individual journal policies you can self-archive your research. Check Sherpa ROMEO for deets.</p>
                            <p><em>Longer Answer:</em></br>
                            Most conventional publishers give standing permission for author-initiated green open access. Many of the others will give permission on request. For authors unsure of a publisher's position, check out the Sherpa RoMEO database of publisher policies, read the publishing contract, or ask an editor. It's always worth asking, if only to register demand and show rising expectations.</p>
                            <p>Because this permission comes from publishers themselves, it makes green open access lawful even when authors have transferred all relevant rights to publishers. However, the permission needn't come from publishers. Authors may retain relevant rights, on their own, through author addenda (lawyer-drafted contract modifications), or through open access policies at their funding agency or employer. For example, since 2005 the Wellcome Trust has had a policy requiring Wellcome-funded researchers to retain the right to authorise open access, if the publisher doesn't already permit or provide open access. The US National Institutions of Health (NIH) has had a similar policy since 2008. A new bill in Germany would allow authors to provide green open access to articles arising from publicly-funded research, regardless of their publishing contracts.</p>
                            <p>On the university side, departments in more than 40 universities around the world have adopted policies, inspired by those developed at Harvard, in which faculty grant their institution non-exclusive rights to make their future articles open access. Rights-retention policies like these assure that faculty may make their work open access even when they publish in a non-open access journal, even when the non-open access journal does not give standing permission for green open access, and even when faculty members have not negotiated special access terms or permissions with their publishers.</p>
                            <p>Bottom line: when the best journal in your field is not open access, and you're good enough to be published there, then you can publish there and still make your peer-reviewed text open access through a repository.</p>

The first time a researcher visits the OpenDepot.org, the repository will automatically check with OpenDOAR, the registry for open access repositories, to find a more appropriate local repository. If none exists then the author will be invited to deposit their research in the OpenDepot.org. The OpenDepot.org is OAI-compliant allowing deposited e-prints to be 'harvested' by search services, and other repositories, giving them instant global visibility.</p>

                            There is no direct and clean relationship between open access journals and copyright policy. Many, but not all, open access journals have liberal policies that allow authors to retain copyright. Most traditional subscription-based journals have standard copyright transfer agreements that require authors to turn over copyright upon publication, but some such publishers will agree to negotiate this requirement, or have a standard agreement that is more liberal. The same options exist when publishing through an open access channel as when an article is published through a traditional publishingl: the author may in some cases be able to retain copyright, or may be required to grant the journal publisher copyright. But in either case, the article is still copyrighted, either by the author or the publisher.</br>

                        <div id="faq21" style="display:none;">
                            <p><em>Simple Answer:</em></br>
                            Open access to research and scholarship is not free - there are costs involved in making research available. The economic models to support unrestricted access to research are still being developed; the common thread among the models is that open access research is available at no charge to all readers.
                            <p><em>Longer Answer:</em></br>
                            One model that exists is for there to be a payment when the author submits an article. Usually this charge to publish an open access article is covered by research grant funds. In 2004, one study by Elsevier found that this "author side" payment model encompassed just 17% of open access journals. In an updated study in 2007, Bill Hooker did a survey of all known open access journals and found that only 18% charged fees. The open access publisher BioMed Central offers a table comparing such author side payments.
                            Other economic models are also being experimented with. For example, some new open access publishers, such as the for-profit BioMed Central, require author payments, but these are waived for institutions who've purchased a membership, as the MIT Libraries have for MIT. In other cases, such as the not-for-profit PLoS (Public Library of Science), the MIT Libraries' institutional membership reduces the publication fee for MIT faculty and researchers.
                            Other titles are subsidized, often by scholarly societies, institutions, or foundations. The 2004 Elsevier study found that government or university subsidies accounted for 55% of the total open access titles, the largest portion. The remaining open access titles (28%) that were not supported by 'author side' payments, or by government or universities, were found to be subsidized by paid subscriptions to their print equivalents.
                            Some journals are entirely open access; every article is available without restriction. Other journals are 'hybrid' in that they are traditional subscription-based journals, but offer authors the choice to pay a fee to make their individual article freely accessible to anyone worldwide. The other articles in the journal remain accessible only through subscription.
                            Some publishers offer all their titles under one kind of open access policy, and others have different policies for different titles. In 2006, the MIT Press launched its first entirely open access journal, Information Technologies and International Development.

                            No. The author's consent to open access for a given article is manifested by self-archiving the article in an open access repository, by publishing it in an open access journal, or by some explicit statement attached to the article. Open access repositories and journals will help readers by making clear that they offer open access to all their contents, and they will respect authors by offering open access only to the works for which their authors have consented to open access. However, if a copyrighted work is on the internet but not in such an archive or journal, and there is no other indication of the copyright holder's wishes, then users should seek permission for any copying that would exceed fair use.

                            <p>There are a number of strategies to reach Open Access to research. Open Access delivered by journals is called "gold" Open Access and Open Access delivered by repositories is called "green" Open Access. There is a myth that all Open Access is gold , even for peer-reviewed articles but that is not true. Today most Open Access in medicine and biomedicine is gold, but in every other field it's mostly green.</p>
                            <p>In university and funding agency mandated Open Access, nearly every Open Access policy is a green policy, requiring deposit in an Open Access repository rather than submission to Open Access journals. This guide provides some recommendations for those of you that publish research and who want to publish open access. </p>

                            <p>If you want to publish your work in an Open Access journal, it can be difficult deciding which one and there are a lot of variables that may impact your decision. Things you can do to help are: </p>

                            <p>The <a href="http://doaj.org" target="_blank">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ) is the foremost listing of all Open Access journals out there. At the time of writing, it includes over 10,000 Open Access journals from all fields of publishing. If you regard open access as defined by the Budapest Open Access Initiative, then there are 2159 journals that publish research under a CC-BY licence, the licence most in keeping with the Budapest definition. It is a commonly held misconception that gold open access always equals payment; at the time of writing 6,447 journals did not charge for publishing in their journal. Of those that do there are a lot of journals that provide discounts to for article processing charges or no-questions-asked waivers. Please contact individual journals for more details about waivers and discounts.</p>
                            <p>Journals that support themselves financially by charging APCs to support the costs associated with publication are aware that some researchers do not have a means by which to pay. Therefore they have established systems and eligibility criteria for those researchers in need, to apply for fee waivers.</p>
                            <p>Fees can either be waived in their entirety, or a partial discount off the standard APC may be offered, depending on your eligibility criteria. If you can't find their waiver/discount policy email the journal/publisher to ask about it.</p>

                            <p>To help identify predatory journals, they typically:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Accept articles quickly with little or no peer review or quality control.
                                <li>Notify academics of article fees only after papers are accepted.
                                <li>Aggressively campaign for academics to submit articles or serve on editorial boards (all those spam emails you get).
                                <li>List academics as members of editorial boards without their permission, and not allowing academics to resign from editorial boards.
                                <li>Appoint fake academics to editorial boards.
                                <li>Mimic the name or web site style of more established journals.
                                <li>Provide misleading claims about the publishing operation, such as a false location.
                                <li>Improperly use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number" target="_blank">ISSN</a>s.
                            </ul>
                            <p>To protect yourself against predatory publishers you can:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ask your librarian for advice
                                <li>Talk to Open Access Advocates and colleagues (however some people just dislike Open Access regardless of journal quality).
                                <li>Read a selection of articles that have previously been published there. Are they of good quality?
                                <li>Have a look at who's on the editorial board of the journal (Do you know who any of the editors are? Is their research relevant to your broad subject area?)
                                <li>Check the journal has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number" target="_blank">ISSN</a> and that the ISSN is <a href="http://journal-index.org/ISSN-validator/" target="_blank">validated</a>,
                                <li>Is the publisher a member of <a href="http://oaspa.org/membership/members/" target="_blank">OASPA</a>? Yes = good sign. No = tread carefully, although, if it's a small society-run journal of good quality then it doesn't matter too much that it's not an OASPA member.
                                <li>Ask yourself, do you read it?
                            </ul>
                            <p>Running basic checks like this before you <em>think</em> of submitting your work to a journal can really help. The final point about reading the journal is important,  a particular journal to publish in may be ok but if researchers in your area don't read this journal or haven't heard of this journal you probably shouldn't submit your work there unless you're sure you want to support the journal with your work.</p>

                            <p>Librarians are awesome. Talk to them! They are a fountain of wisdom and may have funds to support APC-driven open access publishing.</p>
                            <p>Some Open Access journals will reduce the article processing charges to society members, emailing to ask can save a lot in article processing charges.</p>
                            <p>If you can put Open Access publication funding in your grant proposals - research funders recognise that publishing costs money - many are willing to fund this. If your grant does not allow it, reach out to your program manager and ask whether they plan to alter the policy.</p>
                            <p>Many traditional journals will ask you to give them your copyright of your work (this isn't actually necessary for them to publish it, but many still insist), with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_transfer_agreement" target="_blank">Copyright Transfer Agreement</a>.

                            <p>While many publisher contracts have you sign over all the rights, this is certainly not needed for them to publish your research. By only signing over the rights that you need to, you will be able to more easily make your research available openly. You can try this using the following few steps:</p>
                            <ol>
                            <li><a href="http://www.sparc.arl.org/resources/authors/addendum" target="_blank">Complete the addendum from the SPARC website</a>.
                            <li>Note in a cover letter to your publisher that you have included an addendum to their standard agreement.
                            <li>Wait for confirmation from publisher that they have accepted the addendum terms & conditions.
                            </ol>
                            <p>N.B. This route is far from guaranteed to be successful. In some cases publishers will outright reject any attempt to modify their standard agreement terms and conditions. So be prepared to play 'hardball' and withdraw your publication if they don't agree to the addendum. Even if they do eventually agree to the addendum, the whole process can inadvertently slow-up the publication process and these delays may frustrate your co-authors.</p>
                            <p>In addition to this, <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/statistics.php" target="_blank"many conventional publishers</a> allow authors to self archive their work in insitutional repositories</a>, a route that is commonly known as "green open access". If you publish in a non-open access journal, a really useful resource to check the self-archiving policies of traditional journals is the <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/" target="_blank">Sherpa/RoMEO</a> database of publisher policies. From there ask your librarian for help or send us an email at hello@openaccessbutton.org.</p>
                            <p>If you are wanting to self archive your work, the <a href="http://roar.eprints.org/" target="_blank">Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR)</a> lists more than 3,700 repositories, both subject-based open access repositories and institutional open access repositories. </p>

                                Talk to a friend or a colleague about Open Access and the Open Access Button. Try out some conversation starters like:
                                <ul>
                                <li>Have you ever been asked to pay 40 dollars to read a piece of research?</li>
                                <li>Have you ever been denied access to research you need?</li>
                                </ul>
                                Use this time to bust myths (using our <a href="advocacy">guides</a>) about Open Access and highlight the benefits of being Open.</br>
                                During your conversation,
                                <ul>
                                <li>Try to convince your colleagues who may object to Open Access to publish in an Open Access journal.
                                <li>Try to find out why they object to Open Access.
                                </ul>
                                Our <a href="advocacy">guides</a> have a number of resources for tackling the most common myths about Open Access.

Encourage your librarians to include Open Access in the mandatory library orientation for incoming students.  Use our <a href="advocacy">guides</a> to bust those myths and answer questions.</p>

If you don't have a blog, school/local newspapers are around for just this purpose and they're often itching for content. Open Access affects everybody, and an opinion piece or letter to the editor calling for change - in a few hundred words - is sure to garner interested comments or emails. If you're writing for a blog or for a newspaper, let us know and we can help.</p>
                                <h4>Get your organisations on board</h4>
                                <p>Lots and lots of organizations have an interest in opening up access to academic research. You could bring up anything from the access barriers at your institution to the heavy toll lack of access to research has on students, researchers, patients, and doctors all over the world, or something else. Let them know that access is an issue and urge them to join advocacy efforts.</p>
